# OMIS-114-Air-Traffic-Final-Project-

For our OMIS 114 final project, we were curious about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on airport traffic. How has the pandemic affected the travel industry? Has the number of planes flying in and out of the airport increased or decreased? As the world slowly returns to normal levels of plane activity and travel, we wanted to see just how much air traffic was affected across airports all over the world. To look at this further, we will be using the dataset called “COVID-19's Impact on Airport Traffic: Analysis of Traffic Volume Post-COVID”.

This data set tracks the traffic in airports by the number of planes flying in and out per day. Each day is recorded as a percentage of the baseline traffic, which was the average traffic from February 1st to March 15th, 2020. The data observed is from March 16th, 2020 to December 1st, 2020. 

We plan to observe state, region, and country airport traffic trends to determine how different populations reacted to the Covid-19 pandemic and changed their travel patterns. Therefore, we plan to explore the data using the PercentOfBaseline, Date, Country, State, and Centroid columns. We plan to use the Centroid column, which contains coordinates of the respective airport, to split each airport into a region of the US. 

Not only do we plan to cover as many aspects that we can draw from the dataset, but we  also want to demonstrate some of the tools and libraries we have been learning in this course. The overall functions we have learned in this course will be very helpful in analyzing the information and trends presented in the dataset. By completing this project, we hope to learn more about air traffic trends and acknowledge the seriousness of the pandemic on the travel industry. We also wish to thank all airport employees, pilots, and flight attendants for their hard work during the last year.
